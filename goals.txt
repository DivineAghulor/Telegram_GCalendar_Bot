Project Roadmap
TO-DO:
Gotta update access rules to the table and to the storage bucket. Make them private and add RLS
Storage bucket url lasts only a year
Why cant I just add it manually as a row on the table and then request for that row in particular


You can add functionalities of google calendar later
The forwarded message should automatically become a calendar event, then you add title and date


Figure out how to make certain tasks repeated

Stage 1:
Create telegram bot 
Manipulate the data
Send a reply
Upload to git

Stage 2:
Create algorithm to parse the string data into json file

Stage 3:
Use google calendar api to learn the kind of data that can be passed
Fine tune algorithm for parsing string data

Stage 4:
Practice sending data back and forth

Stage 5:
Work on telegram bot features to explain different functionalities
Also selection of date and time

Stage 6:
Work on different users signing in to google.

Stage 7:
Work on bugs

Stage 8:
Add more features to make bot experience better. E.g. adding other apis from notes or to do apps or others, adding telegram reminders, etc. 

Stage ...:
Update the algorithm for parsing string data with gemini. 
This should also reach the point where it can communicate with other apis instead of google calendar without explicitly stating it.
